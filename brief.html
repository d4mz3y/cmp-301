            <span>BRIEF HISTORY OF PHP</span>

            <p>
                PHP was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. 
                Originally, he has written some programs in C to perform some actions on his static website he had created for himself on the newly burgeoning internet. 
                In doing so, he had unintentionally laid the foundation for new programming language, 
                one that's purpose was primarily to interact with the servers and databases used to house his static files, 
                and bring more life to the static sites that were the status quo of the internet at the time. 
                The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. 
                PHP initially stood for Personal Home Page, 
                but it now stands for  PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.
